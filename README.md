# sql-challenge
Folder "Starter_Code" contains the source csv files for reference.
tableschemata.sql contains the schemata for the table.
queries.sql contains all of the queries. Although the assignment does not have numbers, I used a numbering system in sequential order for the bullet points in the "Data Analysis" subsection to keep track of all of the analysis requests. 
The database I used in postgreSQL is named "sql_challenge_table_schemata_isummers". In hindsight, I would've used something shorter but did not want to go back and rewrite all of my queries. Apologies for the wordiness.
"SQL Challenge - ERD.png" is the ERD sketch used to create the table schemata. Illustration was made in Quick Database Diagrams pro version. 
Stack Overflow was used to answer questions about relationships between the tables. The SQL queries were proofread in ChatGPT, and re-run in postgreSQL to ensure functionality.
